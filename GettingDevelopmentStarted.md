#### Introduction
The team's current preferred IDE is Intellij IDEA.


#### Setting up your environment
1. You should define a Intellij path variable called `SPIGOT_DEVSERVER` and set it's value to the server root of your
Spigot development server.
You can configure Intellij IDEA path variables at `File > Settings > Appearance & Behaviour > Path Variables`

2. You should also define an (system) environment variable, also called `SPIGOT_DEVSERVER`
with the same value as the previous one.

3. Your server jar should be called `spigot.jar`

4. You should use the default directory structure for the Spigot server.
